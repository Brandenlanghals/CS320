How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

- By testing each requirement using unit testing as demonstrated in this course I am able to ensure that each requirement is meeting expectations. To ensure code is secure I create clean and easy to read code that can be checked using a dependency check. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

- To interpret the needs of the user I considered the stakeholders' requirements and how they would be brought to life in the UI. Users need to be able to easily navigate the system and make full use of each of its components. This is important for any application but of particular value in SASS systems and ones involving education. If the user struggles with the UI they are less likely to continue paying for a plan, and ultimately are more likely to fail in testing.

How do I approach designing software?

- First I need to gather requirements and work with stakeholders to figure out what problem we are trying to solve for our end-user. Then I would consider all its actors and the goal of the system. I find it is easier to start at the top with where the actor first exists, then mark down the end goal. After this, dig into what is required and the steps to get there, this is going to fill in the middle. If we correctly go from the user to the end result, we should have mapped out most of the product requirements and should feel confident moving forward with development.
